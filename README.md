# Algorithm Visualizer 

Welcome to the Algorithm Visualizer for Stack and Queue! This tool is designed to help you understand how stack-based and Queue-based algorithms work by visualizing their operation step by step.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: See how stack-based algorithms manipulate data structures in real-time.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Explore stack and Queue algorithms, including push, pop, peek, and more.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Follow the execution of each algorithm with detailed step-by-step explanations.
- **Visual Representation**: Watch as elements are pushed onto and popped off the stack, with visual cues for better understanding.

## Supported Algorithms

## **Queue Algorithm**
- **Enqueue**
- **Dequeue**

## Stack Algorithms
- **Push**: Add elements onto the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove elements from the top of the stack.
- **Peek**: View the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
- **Stack Operations**: Explore more advanced stack operations like checking for emptiness or fullness.

## How to Use

1. **Select Algorithm**: Choose the algorithm you want to visualize from the dropdown menu.
2. **Set Parameters**: Adjust parameters such as stack size, input values, and algorithm speed.
3. **Run**: Start the visualization to see the algorithm in action.
4. **Step Through**: If desired, step through the algorithm one operation at a time for a more detailed understanding.
5. **Reset**: Reset the visualization to its initial state to try different inputs or algorithms.
